***********************Description of the game***********************
In this game, the objective is for the farmer to get his fox, chicken, and grain safely across a river from the south bank to the north bank. 
The farmer can take at most one thing with him when he makes his trip across the river in his kayak 
Unfortunately, if the farmer leaves the fox and chicken together, the fox will eat the chicken (because it tastes like chicken).
